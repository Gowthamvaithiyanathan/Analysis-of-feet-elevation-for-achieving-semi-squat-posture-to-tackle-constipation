# Analysis-of-feet-elevation-for-achieving-semi-squat-posture-to-tackle-constipation
A project in the field of Mechatronics involving LS Dyna simulation using a human dummy.In this project I simply modeled( 3D ) a squat posture environment for the dummy and measured various anthropometric parameters for the two major squat posture namely upper body upright and upper body bending forward to suggest which squat posture is best. 
Constipation is a common condition that affects people of all ages. It is characterized by infrequent bowel movements or difficulty in passing stools. One of the causes of constipation is the inability to assume a semi-squat posture during defecation, which results in incomplete evacuation of the bowels. 
Several studies have investigated the effectiveness of using foot elevation to achieve a semi-squat posture during defecation, which has been found to be an effective remedy for constipation. Moreover decreased mobility, lack of exercise, improper diet and more usage of drugs also cause constipation. 
Feet elevation is the distance between the user’s feet and the ground after user’s feet is lifted by the squat-assistive device. To achieve proper semi-squat posture, feet  elevation plays a crucial role for an attainment of 30 degree between the leg and torso.
Feet elevation is calculated mathematically by considering the height of the user alone on two conditions.
 - Determination of feet elevation with upper body up right.
 - Determination of feet elevation with upper body bending forward.
   
- conclusion:After analysing the above position in the software, we found that the feet elevation with upper body bending forward is the suitable posture for tackling the constipation
